## About The App

The main goal of the calendar app is to generate timetables for students. This removes the frustration of dealing with course conflicts and makes the course selection more efficient. Additionally, users (students) can add other users as friends and compare their generated timetables for easily plan courses together.

## Status

The project is currently under development

## Technologies

The app uses MERN stack, React, MangoDB, MUI, and course data copied from uoft's artsci course calendar.
